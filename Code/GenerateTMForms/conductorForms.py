# Description: This program iterates through each line of the files irred_pos.txt,
#              irred_neg.txt, as compute by as computed by A. Rechnitzer.
#              It takes as input discF c_1 .. c_4 and outputs
#              on each line of FormsCond10To6.txt
#              N [disc(F),c_1,..,c_4]
#
# Commentary: This program only needs to be applied once.
#             Run with
