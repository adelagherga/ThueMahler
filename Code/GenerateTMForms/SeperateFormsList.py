# Description: This program iterates through each line of the files irred_pos.txt, irred_neg.txt
#              as computed by A. Rechnitzer.
#              It takes as input discF c_1 .. c_4 and outputs on each line of
#              FormsCond10To6_NoN.txt \"(c_1,..,c_4)\"
#
# Commentary:  This program only needs to be applied once.
#              Run with
#              python3 /Users/adela016/Documents/Work/Postdoc/ThueMahler/Code/GenerateTMForms/SeperateFormsList.py > /Users/adela016/Documents/Work/Postdoc/ThueMahler/Data/FormsCond10To6/FormsCond10To6_NoN.txt
