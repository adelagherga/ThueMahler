# Description: This program iterates through each line of the file FormsCond10To6.txt,
#              as computed by A. Rechnitzer.
#              It takes as input N [disc(F_1),c_1,..,c_4],..,[disc(F_n),c_1,..,c_4] and outputs
#              on each line of SortedFormsCond10To6.txt, [N,[disc(F_i),c_1,..,c_4]]
#
# Commentary: This program is now obsolete and is superceded by conductorForms.py.
#             This program only needs to be run once.
#
# To do list: N/A
#
# Example: N/A
#

# runs through every line of FormsCond10To6.txt
