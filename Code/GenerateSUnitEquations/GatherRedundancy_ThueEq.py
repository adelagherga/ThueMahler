# Description: This program iterates through each line of "RegeneratedThueEqToSolve.csv", as
#              computed by "RegeneratedThueEqToSolve_NoSUnitEqNeeded.m" and
#              "RegeneratedThueEqToSolve_TMFormData.m", and generates a list of all unique Thue
#              equations to solve, removing the redundancy present in the aforementioned files.
#              The output is
#
#              "RegeneratedThueEqToSolve.csv" lists all Thue forms to be solved in the format
#              N,"form","optimal form","RHSlist", where the same form and right-hand-side may
#              appear for multiple conductors. This algorithm removes this redundancy.
#
#              The output is printed in the files "ThueEqToSolve_ByRHS.csv" in the format
#              (original) "form",rhs_value,"list of conductors"
#              and "ThueEqToSolve_ByForm.csv" in the format
#              (original) "form",rhs_value
#              Here "ThueEqToSolve_ByRHS.csv" is generated for processing repetitions among
#              conductors, and is not used to solve the Thue equations as it requires
#              reinitializing the same form (and magma) for each rhs value
#
# Commentary:  We ignore the "optimal form" here as it is only optimal in regards to the
#              associated number of S-unit equations, and simply use the original form instead.
#
#              This program only needs to be appli once. Run with
#              python3 /home/adela/ThueMahler/Code/GenerateSUnitEquations/GatherRedundancy_ThueEq.py
