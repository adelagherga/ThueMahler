# Description: This program iterates through the file
#              "/home/adela/ThueMahler/Data/SUnitEqData/AllSUnitEq.txt" and generates the corresponding list of optimal forms to be solved, ignoring those cases for which no sunit equations are needed or where local obstructions occur
#
# Commentary: This program is now obsolete and has been superceded by
#             GenerateSUnitEqsWithoutThueSol.m
#             This program only needs to be applied once and run with
#             python3 /home/adela/ThueMahler/Code/GenerateSUnitEquations/SortAllSUnitEqData.py > /home/adela/ThueMahler/Data/SUnitEqData/OptimalRequiredSUnitEqs.txt
#
# To do list: 0. write code for optimal forms - DONE
#             1. graph data on ranks, time to generate S-unit eqs, size of terms? Possibly in
#                python notebook
#             2. comment both
#             3. rerun this code and the other code, probably
# ideas for python data amalgamation:
#           ranks, conductor
#             4. store local obstructions along with Sunitdata!!


#
# Example:
#

import re

def fargle(X):
    Y = []
    for char in X.split():
        Y.append(int(char.replace(",","")))
    return [Y]

optimal_forms = {}
for line in open("/home/adela/ThueMahler/Data/SUnitEqData/AllSUnitEq.txt"):
    if "Optimal Thue-Mahler equation coefficients:" in line:
        form = (re.search('coefficients: \[(.*)\]',line)).group(1)
        discF = (re.search(',\[(.*)\]]Case', line)).group(1).split(',')[0]
        form = fargle(discF + "," + form)
        N = int((re.search('\[(.*),\[', line)).group(1))
        if N in optimal_forms:
            if form[0] not in optimal_forms[N]:
                optimal_forms[N] = optimal_forms[N] + form
        else:
            optimal_forms[N] = form

for key in sorted(optimal_forms):
    for form in optimal_forms[key]:
        print( "[" + str(key) + "," + str(form).replace(" ","") + "]")
